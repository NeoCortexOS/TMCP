Seems i have to stop further adaptions until this mantis is fixed:
http://opensimulator.org/mantis/view.php?id=6121
The llSetLinkPrimitiveParamsFast is not updating an avatar's position while seated.
Since this is a vital part of the implementation i will wait until this is part of the official opensim code.
