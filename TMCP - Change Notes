Change Notes

0.50 == 0.39B.

0.39
Several bug fixes. Several usability fixes. Sit targets are defined in 'normal' rotation, avoiding avi's in incorrect rotations right after sit down, on some builds (was: depending how linked prims were oriented relative to root).

* Solved a conflict in the LM constants ; MSG_STORAGE_RESET now has constant 341 (was: 391 - in conflict !)
* MSG_RESET was incorrectly set to zero

Sitmanager - various changes:
* Dodged sitting on greater heights
* Improved support for sitting on linked prims
* Small fix to rotation

* Removed all auto-upgrade() functions, freeing up some memory
